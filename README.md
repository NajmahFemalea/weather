This is a project for classifying cloudy, foggy, and rainy weather. To access the website, you can visit the following link: https://weatherpredict.streamlit.app/. On this site, you can try out the weather classification model I have developed by providing sky images and viewing the weather predictions based on those images.

or you can run by following this step:
